# ft_transcendence

A **Pong-based** web application from 42â€™s curriculum, blending **real-time gameplay** with strong **security** and **user management** features. This project pushes boundaries by introducing modules like **2FA**, **OAuth**, **database integration**, and even **blockchain** for storing tournament scores.

## Project Highlights
- **Real-Time Pong**: Play solo or in tournaments, with live matchups and a reactive game loop.
- **User Management**: Registration, login, and profile features with robust security in mind.
- **OAuth**: Integrates an external provider (e.g., 42) for a smooth and secure login flow.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of protection beyond passwords.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Ensures reliable data storage for user info, match history, and more.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Stores tournament outcomes on an Ethereum testnet for immutable score records.

## My Role (Backend & Security)
- **Backend Development**: Implemented routes, APIs, and core logic for user interactions.
- **2FA & OAuth**: Set up token-based authentication and secondary verification flows.
- **Database Management**: Designed schemas and queries in **PostgreSQL**.
- **Blockchain**: Created smart contracts in **Solidity** to log game results securely.
